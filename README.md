This course had two projects.  
In each project, we implemented 4 different algorithms for a data structure.  
And then we performed an empirical comparative analysis of their running times using a variety of test cases.  
The summaries of the two projects are as follows:  

Project 1: Hashing algorithms  
Algorithms implemented: Linear Hashing, Chained Hashing, Cuckoo Hashing, and Coalesced Hashing    
Parameters of test cases: number of elements, load factor, and probability distribution of keys    
Project Description: Please refer to "Project1 Description.pdf."    
Project Report: Please refer to "Project1 Report.pdf."    
Code and test cases: Please refer to the folder "Project1 Hash Tables."      
How to compile and run in Linux: Please refer to "E. COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS" in "Project1 Report.pdf."    

Project 2: Binary trees and their variants    
Algorithms implemented: Standard Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Treap, and Splay Tree    
Parameters of test cases: number of elements, activity ratio, and order of keys    
Project Description: Please refer to "Project2 Description.pdf."     
Project Report: Please refer to "Project2 Report.pdf."      
Code and test cases: Please refer to the folder "Project2 Binary Trees."
